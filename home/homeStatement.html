     <h3>Introduction</h3>
     This website isn't about my work experience but it is about a Javascript/Jquery project in a class @ Lake Washington Institude, winter 2020 that I am taking.
     The project is about to creating a website and deployed it to the GitHub.IO. Building a website isn't just about Javascript/Jquery but it involves HTML, CSS, knowledge of browsers and servers and it also requires skillfullness of designing as well.  I have developed this website in a short period of times to proof of a concept.
     It is to create daily themes (can be a theme too) for a website by using CSS4 feature, the <strong>CSS variables</strong>.<br />
     The daily theme can be used the same way on a website and it can also apply to weather conditions, vacations, critical situations, holidays or special events etc. It can be used in the MRP (Material Requirements Planning) as well.
     Color is worth thousand words.
     <br>
     <strong>Not all of browers do support CSS variables at this moment and this project has been tested with Windows 10, Chrome (latest), Boostrap 4.3.1 + Icons and Jquery 3.4.1.
     </strong>
