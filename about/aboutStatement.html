<h3>MRP and Quality Triangle (Time, Cost and Quality)</h3>
<article>
     My work experiences or my backgrounds were from manufactured environments. Therefore, I do know <strong>MRP, Time, Cost and Quality</strong> and rdbms such as Multivalue Pick/Universe, Oracle,MsSQL and NoSql.  I had worked in small groups to one person in a shop and I have done many functions from database backend to user interface/training including Web API as well.
     My tasks start from getting requests to deployments and then monitorings and enhancements.

     My resume is available upon request.
